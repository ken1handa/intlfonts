BDF fonts:

Most BDF fonts contain copyright notices.  README files under
subdirectories also describe copyright condition of each file.

Almost all of them are free, i.e. explicitly stated as freely usable,
Public Domain, or GPL.  The exceptions are big fonts for Chinese and
Japanese.

The fonts cnsX-40.bdf and cc48s.bdf in the directory Chinese.BIG are
distributed at ftp://ftp.ifcss.org/pub/software/fonts/ (the most
famous site for Chinese softwares), but there's no explicit statement
about the usage, free or not.  Thus the copying condition of fonts
generated from these files (e.g. Chinese/cns3-16.bdf) are also
unclear.

The fonts j83-32.bdf and j83-48.bdf in the directory Japanese.BIG are
also distributed at many sites, but there's no explicit statement
about the usage, free or not.

TrueType and Type1 fonts:

All these fonts are contributed by the Omega Project to be used
freely.
